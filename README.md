The attached project is a poorly written products API.

The task is to study this project and discuss / suggest the changes to this project which you would make to improve it.

There is no time limit (we all work at different speed!), but as a guideline, we recommend taking a bit of time familiarising youself with the project as we will use it for that basis of the interview.

When analysing the code please consider all aspects of good software engineering (including but not limited to design, reliability, readability, extensibility, quality) 


Good luck!

## Instructions

To set up the project:

* Open project in VS.
* Restore nuget packages and rebuild.
* Run the project.

There should be these endpoints:

1. `GET /products` - gets all products.
2. `GET /products?name={name}` - finds all products matching the specified name.
3. `GET /products/{id}` - gets the project that matches the specified ID - ID is a GUID.
4. `POST /products` - creates a new product.
5. `PUT /products/{id}` - updates a product.
6. `DELETE /products/{id}` - deletes a product and its options.
7. `GET /products/{id}/options` - finds all options for a specified product.
8. `GET /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - finds the specified product option for the specified product.
9. `POST /products/{id}/options` - adds a new product option to the specified product.
10. `PUT /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - updates the specified product option.
11. `DELETE /products/{id}/options/{optionId}` - deletes the specified product option.

All models are specified in the `/Models` folder, but should conform to:
